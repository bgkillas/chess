# chess
a cli chess implementation written in rust

made in and tested for linux i think everything is os independent though you will have to compile yourself for now

Usage: chess [OPTION]...

--flip will flip the board each move

--numbers will show 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 on the bottom instead of a b c d e f g h

--file CSV will load a board from a csv file

8x8.csv is an example which is just the default board

26x26.csv is just a silly board example with a 26x26 grid

typing EXIT returns all the moves and exits
