# chess
a cli chess implementation written in rust
```
Usage: chess [OPTION]...
--flip will flip the board each move
--numbers will show 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 on the bottom instead of a b c d e f g h
--file CSV will load a board from a csv file
--black will make you play as black
--ip IP will connect to a server at IP:port
--bot will play against a bot
```
8x8.csv is an example which is just the default board

26x26.csv is just a silly board example with a 26x26 grid

typing EXIT returns all the moves and exits
